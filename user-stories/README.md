# 📖 Airbnb Clone Backend – User Stories Documentation

## 📌 Overview
This document provides an overview of the user stories designed for the **Airbnb Clone Backend** project. These stories reflect the core interactions users will have with the system, based on the defined use cases and features.

User stories are an essential part of agile development. They guide the implementation of backend features by expressing user needs and expectations in a structured, user-centered format.

## 🧑‍💻 Purpose of User Stories

User stories help the development team:

- Understand **who** the user is  
- Identify **what** they want to do  
- Clarify **why** it’s important  

Each story is written from the perspective of the end user or system role (Guest, Host, Admin), ensuring that functionality directly supports user goals.
